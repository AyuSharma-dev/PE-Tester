# Platform Event Tester

This tool helps testing the Salesforce Platform Events by subscribing to them and showing the published information in tabuler form. Before to test out the Platform Events Integration developers had to either subscribe through Apex Trigger or need to check on the External system which they may not have access to.


# How To Use

&#10157;Go to the tool that is hosted [here](petester.herokuapp.com).<br/>
&#10157; Select your Org Type Production or Sandbox and click on Submit.<br/>
&#10157; Enter your credentials ( This is Salesforce native page we are not storing your credentials ).<br/>
&#10157; Now on the next screen you can see a text box, enter Platform Event API name here that you want to test.<br/>
&#10157; If everything goes well you can see message: "Listening to your Platform Events...".<br/>
&#10157; Now Publish events from Salesforce or anywhere else, you can see the Published data in Tabular form.<br/>
&#10157; If anything goes wrong feel free to raise an issue on repository, no tool is perfect :)
